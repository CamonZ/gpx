               <h2>What</h2>
               <p> <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</a> is an XML
               format for GPS data.  Many personal GPS devices now support
               outputting their track logs to GPX.  If you want to do something
                  fun with the data from your GPS device, then this might be a
               good place to start.

               <h2>Why</h2>

               <p>

               This gem is the direct result of my work on a site I once wrote called WalkingBoss (RIP).  
               It powered the trip creation and editing parts of the site.  After talking
               about WalkingBoss at a few different Ruby groups and RailsConf,
               I was convinced that I really should release this code back to
               the community.  After all, a large portion of the site would not
               exist were it not for the many other open source ruby projects I
               used in creating it.
               <br/>
               <br/>

               <h2>How</h2>
               <p>

               Version 0.1 of this library relied entirely on REXML for XML
               parsing, which was convenient (no dependencies) but slow on
               large GPX files.  Since version 0.2, the library relies on 
               <a href="http://libxml.rubyforge.org/">the libxml-ruby bindings</a>.  
               Instead of taking minutes to run, the unit tests now take a matter 
               of seconds.
